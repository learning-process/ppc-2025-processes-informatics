# <Task Full Name>

- Student: <Last First Middle>, group <Group>
- Technology: <SEQ | MPI | OMP | TBB | STL | ALL>
- Variant: <N>

## 1. Introduction
Brief motivation, problem context, expected outcome.

## 2. Problem Statement
Formal task definition, input/output format, constraints.

## 3. Baseline Algorithm (Sequential)
Describe the base algorithm with enough detail to reproduce.

## 4. Parallelization Scheme
- For MPI: data distribution, communication pattern/topology, rank roles.
- For threads: decomposition, scheduling, synchronization.
Diagrams or short pseudocode are welcome.

## 5. Implementation Details
- Code structure (files, key classes/functions)
- Important assumptions and corner cases
- Memory usage considerations

## 6. Experimental Setup
- Hardware/OS: CPU model, cores/threads, RAM, OS version
- Toolchain: compiler, version, build type (Release/RelWithDebInfo)
- Environment: PPC_NUM_THREADS / PPC_NUM_PROC, other relevant vars
- Data: how test data is generated or sourced (relative paths)

## 7. Results and Discussion

### 7.1 Correctness
Briefly explain how correctness was verified (reference results, invariants, unit tests).

### 7.2 Performance
Present time, speedup and efficiency. Example table:

| Mode        | Count | Time, s | Speedup | Efficiency |
|-------------|-------|---------|---------|------------|
| seq         | 1     | 1.234   | 1.00    | N/A        |
| omp         | 2     | 0.700   | 1.76    | 88.0%      |
| omp         | 4     | 0.390   | 3.16    | 79.0%      |

Optionally add plots (use relative paths), and discuss bottlenecks and scalability limits.

## 8. Conclusions
Summarize findings and limitations.
